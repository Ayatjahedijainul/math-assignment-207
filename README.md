# Matrix Transpose Program

## Description
This C++ program takes as input a rectangular matrix of dimensions M x N and computes its transpose. The transpose of a matrix is formed by swapping rows and columns, resulting in an N x M matrix. The program reads matrix elements from the user, performs the transpose operation, and then displays the transposed matrix.

## What This Program Does
- Takes input for the number of rows (M) and columns (N).
- Reads the elements of the original M x N matrix (Matrix A).
- Creates the transpose matrix (Matrix B) of size N x M by swapping rows and columns.
- Prints the transposed matrix in matrix format.

## Example
Enter the numbers of Row : 2
Enter the numbers of Column : 3
Enter Elements of rectangular matrix A :
1 2 3
4 5 6
Transpose of matrix A is matrix B:
1 4
2 5
3 6

# Square Matrix Transpose Program

## Description
This C++ program takes a square matrix as input and computes its transpose in place. The transpose operation swaps elements symmetrically around the main diagonal, turning rows into columns without requiring extra memory for another matrix.

## Features
- Inputs the size of the square matrix (number of rows and columns).
- Reads matrix elements from the user.
- Performs an in-place transpose by swapping elements above the diagonal with their counterparts below the diagonal.
- Outputs the transposed matrix in a readable format.

## Example
Enter the numbers of Row :3
Enter the numbers of column :3
Enter the Elements of square matrix :
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
Transpose of a square matrix:
1 4 7
2 5 8
3 6 9
