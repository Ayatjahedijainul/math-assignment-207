# Matrix Transpose Program

## Description
This C++ program takes as input a rectangular matrix of dimensions M x N and computes its transpose. The transpose of a matrix is formed by swapping rows and columns, resulting in an N x M matrix. The program reads matrix elements from the user, performs the transpose operation, and then displays the transposed matrix.

## What This Program Does
- Takes input for the number of rows (M) and columns (N).
- Reads the elements of the original M x N matrix (Matrix A).
- Creates the transpose matrix (Matrix B) of size N x M by swapping rows and columns.
- Prints the transposed matrix in matrix format.

## Example
Enter the numbers of Row : 2
Enter the numbers of Column : 3
Enter Elements of rectangular matrix A :
1 2 3
4 5 6
Transpose of matrix A is matrix B:
1 4
2 5
3 6
